# 🎯 Executive Summary Dashboard

## Quick Decision Framework
Use this 5-minute assessment for go/no-go decisions:

### ✅ Ready for Production
**All of these must be true:**
- Manual Dataset Strict Accuracy ≥ 82%
- Coverage Dataset Strict Accuracy ≥ 75%  
- Synthesis Dataset Strict Accuracy ≥ 68%
- No critical safety metrics below thresholds

### ⚠️ Deploy with Caution
**Some concerns, but workable:**
- 2/3 datasets meet strict accuracy targets
- All safety metrics (F-tier detection) ≥ 0.70
- Clear monitoring and fallback plans

### ❌ Not Ready for Deployment
**Significant issues:**
- <2 datasets meet strict accuracy targets
- Any safety metrics < 0.70
- Fundamental capability gaps identified

# 💼 Business Application Scenarios

## 🏥 Healthcare & Medical Applications

### Critical Requirements
- **Safety First**: F-tier F1 ≥ 0.80 (must filter bad medical sources)
- **High Confidence**: Validity 6 F1 ≥ 0.85 (treatment decisions need certainty)
- **Conservative**: Validity 1 F1 ≥ 0.80 (must recognize when evidence is poor)

### Deployment Decision Matrix
| Metrics | Business Decision | Risk Level |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| All critical requirements met | **Full deployment** with medical oversight | Low |
| F-tier F1 ≥ 0.75, others met | **Pilot deployment** with expert validation | Medium |
| Any F-tier F1 < 0.75 | **Do not deploy** - patient safety risk | High |

### ROI Considerations
- **High-value use case**: Medical literature review, diagnosis support
- **Cost of errors**: Extremely high (patient harm, liability)
- **Minimum viable performance**: Higher than general applications

## 🏢 Enterprise Business Intelligence

### Standard Requirements
- **Balanced Performance**: Reliability Macro F1 ≥ 0.75
- **Practical Focus**: Validity 2 F1 ≥ 0.72 (handles everyday uncertainty)
- **Quality Sources**: A-tier F1 ≥ 0.80 (finds premium business intelligence)

### Deployment Decision Matrix
| Performance Level | Business Decision | Investment Level |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Exceeds all requirements | **Scale rapidly** across use cases | High investment |
| Meets all requirements | **Standard deployment** with monitoring | Medium investment |  
| Meets 2/3 requirements | **Limited pilot** in low-risk areas | Low investment |

### Business Impact Areas
- **Market research**: Needs high A-tier F1 for quality sources
- **Competitive intelligence**: Needs balanced macro F1 
- **Risk assessment**: Needs high Validity 1 F1 for safety

## ⚖️ Legal & Compliance Applications

### Critical Requirements
- **Precedent Quality**: A-tier F1 ≥ 0.85 (legal sources must be authoritative)
- **Avoid Bad Law**: F-tier F1 ≥ 0.80 (dangerous to cite poor sources)
- **High Confidence Only**: Validity 5-6 F1 ≥ 0.80 (legal advice needs certainty)

### Risk Assessment
| Metric Performance | Legal Risk | Deployment Decision |
|-------------------|------------|-------------------|
| All requirements exceeded | Low | **Full deployment** for research |
| A-tier ≥ 0.80, F-tier ≥ 0.75 | Medium | **Supervised deployment** with lawyer review |
| Any requirement < 0.75 | High | **Research only** - no client-facing use |

## 📰 Media & Content Applications

### Balanced Requirements
- **Source Diversity**: B-tier, C-tier F1 ≥ 0.75 (everyday news sources)
- **Misinformation Filter**: F-tier F1 ≥ 0.75 (protect readers)
- **Confidence Range**: Validity 2-4 F1 ≥ 0.70 (practical confidence levels)

### Content Strategy Impact
- **High B/C-tier F1**: Can assess mainstream news reliably
- **High Validity 2 F1**: Good at handling conflicting reports
- **High F-tier F1**: Effective misinformation filtering

# 📈 Model Comparison for Business Decisions

## Vendor Selection Framework

### Step 1: Safety Screening
**Eliminate any model with:**
- F-tier F1 < 0.70 (safety risk)
- Validity 1 F1 < 0.65 (overconfidence risk)
- Strict accuracy < 50% on any dataset (fundamental failure)

### Step 2: Capability Ranking
**Rank remaining models by:**
1. **Primary**: Strict accuracy on most relevant dataset
2. **Secondary**: Reliability accuracy (source assessment quality)
3. **Tertiary**: Validity accuracy (confidence calibration)

### Step 3: Business Fit Analysis
**Consider specific needs:**
- **Premium applications**: Prioritize A-tier F1 and Validity 6 F1
- **Safety-critical**: Prioritize F-tier F1 and Validity 1 F1  
- **High-volume**: Prioritize Validity 2 F1 and macro F1 scores

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Model Performance Tiers

#### **Tier 1 Models** (Premium)
- **Performance**: Strict accuracy ≥ 80% across datasets
- **Cost**: Highest (premium model pricing)
- **Use case**: High-stakes applications, enterprise deployment
- **ROI timeline**: 6-12 months

#### **Tier 2 Models** (Standard)
- **Performance**: Strict accuracy 70-79% across datasets  
- **Cost**: Medium (standard model pricing)
- **Use case**: Standard business applications
- **ROI timeline**: 3-6 months

#### **Tier 3 Models** (Budget)
- **Performance**: Strict accuracy 60-69% across datasets
- **Cost**: Lowest (budget model pricing)
- **Use case**: Low-risk applications, experimentation
- **ROI timeline**: 1-3 months

### Investment Decision Matrix
| Business Value | Model Tier 1 | Model Tier 2 | Model Tier 3 |
|----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **High-stakes** (Medical, Legal) | ✅ Recommended | ⚠️ With oversight | ❌ Too risky |
| **Standard** (Business, Media) | ✅ Premium option | ✅ Recommended | ⚠️ Budget option |
| **Experimental** (Research, Pilot) | 💰 Overpriced | ⚠️ Good option | ✅ Recommended |
