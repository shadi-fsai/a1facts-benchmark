# üîç Understanding Precision, Recall, and F1

## Precision
**Formula**: `True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)`  
**Range**: 0.0 - 1.0

### What It Measures
Of all the cases the model predicted as a specific rating, what percentage were actually that rating?

### Business Interpretation
- **High Precision**: When model says "A-tier source," it's usually right
- **Low Precision**: Model over-classifies - gives rating too often
- **Impact**: User trust - do predictions match reality?

### Example
```
reliability_A_precision: 0.89
```
**Meaning**: When model predicts "A-tier source", it's correct 89% of the time.

## Recall  
**Formula**: `True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)`  
**Range**: 0.0 - 1.0

### What It Measures
Of all the actual cases of a specific rating, what percentage did the model correctly identify?

### Business Interpretation
- **High Recall**: Model catches most sources of that quality level
- **Low Recall**: Model misses many sources of that rating
- **Impact**: Completeness - does model find what you need?

### Example
```
reliability_A_recall: 0.85
```
**Meaning**: Model correctly identifies 85% of actual A-tier sources.

## F1 Score
**Formula**: `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`  
**Range**: 0.0 - 1.0

### What It Measures
Balanced measure combining both precision and recall - the harmonic mean.

### Business Interpretation
- **High F1**: Good balance of accuracy and completeness
- **Low F1**: Problems with either accuracy or completeness (or both)
- **Impact**: Overall reliability for that rating level

### Example
```
reliability_A_f1: 0.87
```
**Meaning**: Balanced A-tier source performance of 87%.

# üìä Confusion Matrices

## Reliability Confusion Matrix
**Format**: 6x6 matrix (A, B, C, D, E, F)

### Reading the Matrix
- **Rows**: Actual reliability ratings (ground truth)
- **Columns**: Predicted reliability ratings (model output)
- **Diagonal**: Correct predictions
- **Off-diagonal**: Errors

### Key Patterns

#### **Upper Triangle Errors** (Predicting higher quality than actual)
- **Example**: Predicting B when actual is D
- **Business risk**: **Dangerous** - trusting unreliable sources
- **Action**: Reduce false confidence, improve low-quality detection

#### **Lower Triangle Errors** (Predicting lower quality than actual)  
- **Example**: Predicting D when actual is B
- **Business risk**: **Inefficient** - missing good sources
- **Action**: Improve high-quality source recognition

#### **Diagonal Concentration**
- **High diagonal values**: Good overall performance
- **Low diagonal values**: Poor classification accuracy

### Business Interpretation
```
Reliability Confusion Matrix:
        A   B   C   D   E   F
    A  85   8   2   1   0   0  (A-tier: 85% correct)
    B   3  78  12   4   1   0  (B-tier: 78% correct)  
    C   1   9  71  15   3   1  (C-tier: 71% correct)
    D   0   2  18  68   8   4  (D-tier: 68% correct)
    E   0   1   5  12  75   7  (E-tier: 75% correct)
    F   0   0   1   3   8  88  (F-tier: 88% correct)
```

**Analysis**: 
- Strong A-tier and F-tier performance (safety)
- Some confusion in middle ratings (C/D boundary)
- Acceptable overall pattern for deployment

## Validity Confusion Matrix  
**Format**: 6x6 matrix (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

### Key Patterns

#### **Higher Confidence Errors** (Predicting higher confidence than warranted)
- **Business risk**: **Very dangerous** - overconfident decisions
- **Priority**: **Highest** - must minimize these errors
- **Example**: Predicting 5 when actual is 2

#### **Lower Confidence Errors** (Predicting lower confidence than warranted)
- **Business risk**: **Inefficient** - missed opportunities  
- **Priority**: **Medium** - optimize for better utilization
- **Example**: Predicting 2 when actual is 5

#### **Adjacent Errors** (Off by one level)
- **Business risk**: **Low** - minor calibration issues
- **Priority**: **Low** - fine-tuning opportunity
- **Example**: Predicting 3 when actual is 4

### Business Interpretation
Focus on patterns that indicate overconfidence (dangerous) vs. under-confidence (inefficient).
