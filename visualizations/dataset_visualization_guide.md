Each dataset requires a different analytical approach based on its unique characteristics:


## ðŸ“Š TRIANGULATION Dataset Analysis

**Cases**: 134 | **Primary Focus**: Relative Accuracy & Validity Assessment

### ðŸŽ¯ Why This Focus Matters
Original triangulation methodology with realistic case distribution

### ðŸš¨ Critical Finding  
**Models generally stronger at reliability than validity assessment**

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualization Insights
- Individual accuracy comparison (validity vs reliability)
- Validity assessment capabilities across levels 1-6
- Model consistency and performance patterns
- Macro F1 scores accounting for class imbalance

### ðŸš€ Generate Visualizations
```bash
python visualize_results.py
```

**Output Location**: `visualizations/triangulation_*`

## ðŸ“Š MANUAL_300 Dataset Analysis

**Cases**: 300 | **Primary Focus**: Strict Accuracy (Both Correct)

### ðŸŽ¯ Why This Focus Matters
High-quality manual cases with perfect balance across reliability grades

### ðŸš¨ Critical Finding  
**Grade C reliability completely undetectable by all models (0% performance)**

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Visualization Insights
- Strict accuracy (both validity + reliability correct)
- Grade C reliability detection (critical gap)
- Per-class F1 scores for balanced evaluation
- Model ranking based on overall performance

### ðŸš€ Generate Visualizations
```bash
python visualize_manual_300.py
```

**Output Location**: `visualizations/manual_300_*`
