It is not usually reliable (D) for specific, quantitative crop production forecasts.\n\n**Information Validity:**  \n- The USDA projection of a 4% decrease in corn harvest (14.9 billion bushels) due to drought is a specific, data-driven estimate from the most authoritative source available.\n- agriculture.com\u2019s report of below-trend yields (165 bushels/acre) due to heat stress and irregular rainfall is consistent with the USDA\u2019s explanation for reduced production, providing logical and contextual support.\n- farmers-almanac.com\u2019s claim of a 30% nationwide crop failure is not corroborated by either the USDA or agriculture.com and is significantly more extreme than the other two sources, making it doubtful and likely exaggerated.\n\n**Triangulation:**  \n- The core data (reduced harvest, below-trend yields, weather-related stress) is supported by two independent, generally reliable sources (usda.gov and agriculture.com).\n- The extreme claim from farmers-almanac.com is not supported by any other source and contradicts the more moderate, data-driven estimates.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe information about a reduced US corn harvest in 2024 due to adverse weather is probably true (2), as it is logical, consistent, and supported by multiple reliable sources. However, the most extreme prediction (30% crop failure) is not corroborated and should be considered doubtful. The overall assessment is \"probably true\" rather than \"confirmed\" because only two sources (one official, one industry) corroborate the main trend, and the third source is unreliable and contradictory."

While it is not a primary data source, it is widely used and respected in the field, so it receives a \"B\" rating.\n\nThe information in question\u2014Starlink's constellation size, global broadband coverage, and industry leadership\u2014is consistent across these sources, but there are some discrepancies in the exact number of active satellites (5,400 per Starlink vs. 8,800 tracked by ITU, which includes all LEO satellites, not just Starlink). The average speed and coverage claims from Starlink are plausible and align with independent reports, but are not directly corroborated by the ITU or SpaceNews.\n\nGiven that the core facts are logical, consistent, and supported by at least one highly reliable independent source (ITU), but not all specific details are fully corroborated by multiple independent sources, the overall validity is rated as \"2: Probably true.\""
