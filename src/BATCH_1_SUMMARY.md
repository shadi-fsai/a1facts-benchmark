3. **confirmed_003**: Historical event (2020 election results) - AP, BBC, Reuters
4. **confirmed_004**: Clinical trial (Pembrolizumab enrollment) - ClinicalTrials.gov, NEJM, FDA

### Validity Rating 2 - Probably True (4 cases)
1. **probably_001**: Market reaction (Tesla profits → stock rise → analyst upgrade)
2. **probably_002**: Medical correlation (Drug efficacy → recommendations → sales)
3. **probably_003**: Drug safety (FDA data → medical advice → patient info)
4. **probably_004**: Technology trend (Acquisition + hiring → predicted announcement)

### Validity Rating 3 - Possibly True (3 cases)
1. **possibly_001**: Geopolitical implication (Ukraine invasion → China readiness → defense stocks)
2. **possibly_002**: Tech speculation (Apple AI chip → semiconductor stocks → industry expectations)
3. **possibly_003**: Medical speculation (Vitamin D immune claims with hedging language)

### Validity Rating 4 - Doubtful (4 cases)
1. **doubtful_001**: Contradiction (Record revenue vs bankruptcy filing)
2. **doubtful_002**: Logical inconsistency (Obesity down, diabetes up, fast food up)
3. **doubtful_003**: Clinical contradiction (Trial shows efficacy but FDA rejected)
4. **doubtful_004**: Mixed reliability (Reputable sources vs unreliable blog contradiction)

### Validity Rating 5 - Improbable (4 cases)
1. **improbable_001**: Mathematical impossibility (5 employees can't generate $10B revenue)
2. **improbable_002**: Temporal impossibility (Product discontinued before release)
3. **improbable_003**: Physical impossibility (Speed × Time ≠ Distance)
4. **improbable_004**: Medical impossibility (Vitamin C cures all cancer) - all E-tier sources

### Validity Rating 6 - Cannot Judge (4 cases)
1. **cannot_judge_001**: Unrelated information (Weather, Bitcoin, NFL - no connection)
2. **cannot_judge_002**: Insufficient context (Vague claims from unknown sources)
3. **cannot_judge_003**: Ambiguous medical (Non-specific health claims)
4. **cannot_judge_004**: Missing context (Trial mentioned but no specifics)

## Key Features
